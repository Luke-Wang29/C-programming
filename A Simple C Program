/*
Name: A program for storing variables in an appropriate format, arithmetical operation, number system conversion, unit conversion and solving quadratic equations
Copy right: Free
Author:Wang Yubo
Description: This program can read full name,a 11-digit integer, float and 2-digit decimal number in appropriate variables. Also, for the 11-digit number,
			 it can divide the first 6 figure of number by the last 5 numbers. It is able to convert numbers read from keyboard from decimal to the octal 
			 and hexadecimal format. In addition, it can convert degrees Calsius to degrees Fahrenheit and degree Kelvin. When entering real number a, b, c,
			 it can judge whether there is any roots and solve the problem by the way.
